# Pawns-Only Chess
Stage 3 of 5 for JetBrains Academy - Kotlin - [Pawns-Only Chess project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/182/stages/924/implement).   
This stage has us add the forward moving of the pawns for the players.
## Requirements
### Description
There are several moves that a pawn can make — a forward move and a capture. In this stage, you need to implement forwards moves only. A forward move is a move that propels your pawn by one rank (horizontal line) if the square is not taken by another pawn, or by two ranks if this is the first move of the pawn:

White's turn. All possible forward moves.
    
![black Forward Moves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64429863/131279609-d9da0b65-5190-4df6-a5bb-172a642c0452.png)   
Black's turn. All possible forward moves.    
    
If a user inputs an invalid or impossible move, warn them with a message and ask for another move.
### Objectives
When a player inputs a valid move, the program should move the pawn and print an updated chessboard (see Example 1).

If a user inputs a move and there is no pawn at the initial square, or it is a pawn of the opposite color, print `No white pawn at <Start position>` or `No black pawn at <Start position>`, where `<Start position>` is the initial square and ask for another move.

Print `Invalid Input` and ask to make another move if the player's move is invalid.
### Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
